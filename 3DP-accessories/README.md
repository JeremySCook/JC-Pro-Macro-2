# 3D Printed accessories for the JCPM2 #

Notes:

Jig-JCPM2-KeySwitch-Jig-NoRetainer.stl has not been tested, however, should work  
to line up keyswitches, and provide spacing for EC-11 encoder without keyswitch retainer
installed.

Jig-EC-11-Helper.stl should not be needed if using the either KeySwitch jig, however  
is a much shorter print, and could be useful in a variety of situations generally.
